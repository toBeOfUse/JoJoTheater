# JOJO THEATER

Video player that keeps multiple clients in sync; a fun chat window that you can keep in the corner while the video is fullscreen; and flashy JoJo theming. Very niche, very chill.

### Built With

Yarn manages the front-end dependencies; Webpack builds the front-end code; ts-node runs the backend. The backbone of the video player is plyr.js; the chat window styling comes from XP.css; and the chat window is given life by Socket.IO.
